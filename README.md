# NeuralNetworkNuke
Python tool to visualise attacking and defending neural networks

# GUI
[![https://infinityjoker-apps.herokuapp.com/](https://pyheroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=infinityjoker-apps&style=plastic)](https://infinityjoker-apps.herokuapp.com/)

 - GUI built using streamlit
 - To use app locally,
    - Clone the repo and run [StartUI.sh](StartUI.sh) to view the app on your browser!
 - App is also hosted remotely on heroku using my common host app,
    - [https://infinityjoker-apps.herokuapp.com/](https://infinityjoker-apps.herokuapp.com/)

    - In the Common Host App, simply choose a project to load and click load and deploy.

    - Then go ahead and use the app! :)

    - If you want to change to another app, simply click on View Other Projects in top left and choose any other project and load and deploy.
 
# Attack Neural Networks
  - FGSM : Normal, Targeted, Iterative
  - Jacobian Based Saliency Map Attack

# Defend Neural Networks
## Adversarial Training
 - Train on the adversarial examples generated by different attacks on top of the model to make it robust to those attacks
 - Unreliable as the attacks may still be able to fool the model
 - Takes extra training time

## Barrage of Random Transforms
 - Train model on a barrage of transformed input images
 - Much more robust than adversarial training
 - Still unreliable and takes extra training time
